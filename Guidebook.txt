Build is for building things.

src is for .cpp files.

include is for .h files.

To rebuild, cd into the build directory and run make

When CMakeLists.txt is updated: {
cd build
cmake ..
make
}


Seems like I still need to add src/ files manually to the ADD_EXECUTABLE command.
I have another option, like using
"file(GLOB SOURCES "src/*.cpp")
add_executable(renderer ${SOURCES})" approach. But I would need to run "cmake .." and then "make" every time the code is updated.
